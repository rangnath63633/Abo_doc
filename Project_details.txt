	I have 3+ years of experience as a java developer I specialize in Java application support, database management, 
	and client technical support.

Recent Company Project Experience:

Application Name: BMC (Book my campus):
client : 9 to 6 solution , 
business offer product on a sas model,
product this was portal for university to share knowladge on compus also manage in how job portal for student.

As a student,
I want to register on the Book My Campus (BMC) portal,
so that I can receive job notifications from organizations and apply for relevant positions.

Explanation of the Project :-
In my most recent project, I worked as a developer on an application called Book My Campus (BMC). This platform serves as a bridge between organizations offering jobs and colleges that register students. The main goal of BMC is to streamline the onboarding process for both organizations and colleges and to facilitate job opportunities for students.

Key Components:

User Roles:
Organizations: Companies looking to hire students. They can publish job openings and notify students.
Colleges: Educational institutions that onboard their students to the BMC platform.
Students: Individuals who register on the platform to receive job notifications and apply for positions.

Onboarding Process:
Organizations and Colleges must complete an onboarding process to join the system. This ensures that only verified entities can publish job offers or register students.
After onboarding, colleges will allow their students to register on the portal.

Student Registration:
During registration, students provide essential information, such as their name, location, and educational background.
Once registration is complete, students receive authentication to confirm their identity and access the platform.
Job Notifications:

Organizations can publish job openings directly on the portal.
When a job is posted, students receive notifications to inform them of new opportunities that match their profiles.
Testing and Interviews:

Students must take tests organized on their respective campuses as part of the job application process. This helps organizations evaluate candidates effectively.
Technology Stack:

Java 8: Used as the primary programming language for backend development.
Spring Boot (3.0.5), Microservices Architecture,MySQL, AWS,
JPA (Java Persistence API): Used for object-relational mapping (ORM) to simplify database interactions.

Key Responsibilities:-
Implementing features for student registration and onboarding processes.
Developing notification mechanisms to inform students of new job postings.
Collaborating with the team to ensure the application follows best practices in microservices design and development.


  Collaboration: Worked closely with cross functional teams to gather requirements and deliver scalable API solutions.

  Agile Methodologies: Actively participated in agile practices like sprint planning and daily stand ups.

2. What is the most challenge which I faced is,
	=====challaging task==================
	Basically when we moving to production so when we are identifying issues so 
	we had preevisly kind of manoletik application we had we tried to moved to 
	production when we converted so there was a ahh because what we happing 
	right so there is acceptance header was passing in the request so our 
	application trying to convert the respective that kind of version like USEN is are 
	that king of version trying to do so that kind of jsp which has not available in 
	our application to identifying that one to render the screen so it was a breaking 
	because regular logs we can see status is 200 but it was failing screen was not 
	loading failing then we are trying to do multiple analysis but using log still 200 
	status code then we tried to enable debug logger so once we enable debug 
	logger so then it tried to spit all the because internal framework will do 
	conversation of data transferring right so it was during the convention it was 
	breaking actually so then we got know that we tried to convert respective 
	format wise, we added a filter with that filter we are basically removing that 
	format what we are going to first in the since the generic format the content 
	has to displayed that we setting in the filter and then after that we tried to 
	able to pic the right UI fail to display in the screen that is the major one what I 
	faced when we migrating that new component

 	A) Query 
	B) Mysql upgradation
	C) Exception handling like Null pointer
	D) Duplicate records inserting in table
