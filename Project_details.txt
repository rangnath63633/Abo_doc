2. What is the most challenge which I faced is,
	=====challaging task==================
	Basically when we moving to production so when we are identifying issues so 
	we had preevisly kind of manoletik application we had we tried to moved to 
	production when we converted so there was a ahh because what we happing 
	right so there is acceptance header was passing in the request so our 
	application trying to convert the respective that kind of version like USEN is are 
	that king of version trying to do so that kind of jsp which has not available in 
	our application to identifying that one to render the screen so it was a breaking 
	because regular logs we can see status is 200 but it was failing screen was not 
	loading failing then we are trying to do multiple analysis but using log still 200 
	status code then we tried to enable debug logger so once we enable debug 
	logger so then it tried to spit all the because internal framework will do 
	conversation of data transferring right so it was during the convention it was 
	breaking actually so then we got know that we tried to convert respective 
	format wise, we added a filter with that filter we are basically removing that 
	format what we are going to first in the since the generic format the content 
	has to displayed that we setting in the filter and then after that we tried to 
	able to pic the right UI fail to display in the screen that is the major one what I 
	faced when we migrating that new component

 	A) Query 
	B) Mysql upgradation
	C) Exception handling like Null pointer
	D) Duplicate records inserting in table
